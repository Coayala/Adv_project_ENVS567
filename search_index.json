[["metabolomics-data-set.html", "Chapter 2 Metabolomics data set", " Chapter 2 Metabolomics data set The metabolomics data set used here was obtained from a soil incubation. The experimental design consisted on soil flasks that were incubated aerobically for up to 60 days. Half of the flasks received a water pulse at the start of the incubation. Four flasks were sacrificed at the start of the incubation (T0), one day after the water pulse (T1), 7 days after the water pulse (T2), 30 days after the water pulse (T3) and 60 days after the water pulse (T4).
