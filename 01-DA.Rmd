# (PART) Differential Abundance (DA) {-}

# Metabolomics data set

The metabolomics data set used here was obtained from a soil incubation.

The experimental design consisted on soil flasks that were incubated aerobically for up to 60 days. Half of the flasks received a water pulse at the start of the incubation. Four flasks were sacrificed at the start of the incubation (**T0**), one day after the water pulse (**T1**), 7 days after the water pulse (**T2**), 30 days after the water pulse (**T3**) and 60 days after the water pulse (**T4**).

```{r exp-da, fig.align='center',fig.cap='Experimental design metabolomics data', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('img/exp_design.PNG')
```

Liquid-chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) data was collected for each of the samples. Spectra data was processed with the software **Compound Discoverer** to generate the following compound abundances.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(DT)
metabolite_abundance <- read_csv('data/metabolite_abundance.csv') %>% 
  column_to_rownames(var = 'FeatureID')
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
datatable(metabolite_abundance, 
          caption = 'Metabolite abundance table',
          options = list(scrollX = TRUE))
```

# Data Exploration and Normalization

The first step for differential abundance analysis is to explore the data and select the best normalization method, which will be achieved using some [custom functions](#nomr-func).

## Exploring multiple normalization methods

Data can be normalized in multiple ways, normalization methods presented here include:
- Global sum normalization
- Median normalization
- Mean Normalization
- VSN Normalization
- Cyclic LOESS Normalization

The custom function `normalize_by_all()` will apply all the normalizations and will log-transform the data

```{r fig.align='center', fig.cap='Normalization methods'}
library(ggpubr)
source('data/functions_da.R')

normalize_by_all(metabolite_abundance)
```

From the plot the best normalization method seem to be either **VSN** or **cyclic LOESS**.

## Normalizing data

```{r}
norm_abundances <- cycloess.norm(metabolite_abundance)
```

# Calculating differential abundance (DA) table

Differential abundance of the metabolite data will also be done using [custom functions]{#diff-abun}.

## Getting vectors with samples per each treatment group

Samples from time **T0** will be used as control to compare the samples from all other time points of the two treatments: Water pulse (WP) and control (CTR).

Sample information will be loaded from a `.csv` table.

```{r warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
metadata <- read_csv('data/metadata.csv')
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
datatable(metadata,
          caption = 'Sample information')
```

## Generating table with differential abundances per feature

Using the function `get_diff_table()` to calculate differential abundance between the different sample groups. This function will calculate the log2FoldChange (*log2FC*) for each feature as well as a *p-value* and *adjusted p-value*.

Because multiple comparisons are needed, nested `for()` loops will be used

```{r}
# Samples at T0
control_samples <- metadata %>% 
  filter(time == 'T0') %>% 
  pull(SampleID)

# Initializing a df to store the results
diff_table <- as.data.frame(matrix(nrow = 0, ncol = 7))

for(treat in c('WP', 'CTR')){
  for(t in c('T1', 'T2', 'T3', 'T4')){
    treatment_samples <- metadata %>% 
      filter(treatment == treat,
             time == t) %>% 
      pull(SampleID)
    
    temp_diff_table <- get_diff_table(norm_abundances,
                                      control.sample_list = control_samples,
                                      treatment.sample_list = treatment_samples,
                                      log2_transformed = TRUE) %>% 
      mutate(comparison = paste0('T0_vs_', treat, '_', t))
    
    diff_table <- rbind(diff_table, temp_diff_table)
    
  }
}
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
datatable(diff_table, 
          caption = 'Differential expression table for all the comparisons',
          options = list(scrollX = TRUE))
```

# Plotting differential abundance data

A couple of plots to explore differential abundance data are generated using additional [custom functions](#plot-label)

## Volcano plots

Volcano plots are used to visualize the up- and downregulated features identified during the differential abundance analysis. Volcanos will be obtained using the `plot_volcano()` custom function.
Because there are multiple comparisons a `for()` loop will be used to generate multiple volcano plots that will be arranged together with `ggarrange()`.

```{r volcano-da, fig.align='center',fig.cap='Volcano plots of metabolite data'}
library(ggpubr)
plot_list <- list()

for(comp in unique(diff_table$comparison)){
  volcano_plot <- diff_table %>% 
  filter(comparison == comp) %>% 
  plot_volcano(.,
               column_with_log2FC = log2FC,
               column_with_pval = pval.adj,
               log2FC.threshold = 1,
               pval.threshold = 0.05) +
    scale_x_continuous(limits = c(-8, 8)) +
    scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 3.5)) +
    labs(title = comp)
  
  plot_list[[length(plot_list) + 1]] <- volcano_plot
}

ggarrange(plotlist = plot_list, ncol = 4, nrow = 2, common.legend = TRUE, legend = 'bottom')
```
